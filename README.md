## Paredit plugin

Paredit (Structural Editing) is a fancy editing style to edit code especially for s-expression, the origin purpose of this plugin is to give a universal paredit support for all programming language when using IntelliJ IDEA-based IDEs, but each language supported in Jetbrains systems holds its own AST structure and it's really complicated to cover all, so just support s-expression for now, luckily you can use splice action in some special condition but not always work.
